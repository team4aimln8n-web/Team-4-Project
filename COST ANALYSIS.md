## Objective of Cost Analysis
The purpose of this cost analysis is to estimate the monthly operational cost of the e-commerce automation system built using Supabase, n8n, and AI agents. 
The analysis focuses on transparency, scalability, and buyer-specific usage patterns rather than fixed assumptions.

## Cost Components Considered
The total monthly cost is divided into the following major components:
- Backend Platform (Supabase)

  -Database storage
  -File storage
  -API requests
  -Authentication usage
  -Edge Functions
  -Realtime connections

- Automation Platform (n8n)

  -Workflow executions
  -Peak concurrency
  -Cloud hosting plan

- AI / LLM Usage

  -AI agent executions
  -Token-based processing cost
  -Monthly execution frequency

- Frontend Hosting

  -Treated as a variable cost
  -Not included in final total due to provider dependency
